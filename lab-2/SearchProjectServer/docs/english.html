Many of us spend hours dreaming of getting away from it all – of getting far from the madding crowd. Two men from the Solomon Islands inadvertently did just that and spent 29 days escaping the rat race. They got lost at sea for over four weeks. Livae Nanjikana and Junior Qoloni set off from Mono Island on September the 3rd in a small motorboat to travel 200km to New Georgia Island. It was a trip they had embarked on several times before. Soon after they set out, they were hit by a storm which played havoc with their navigation system. They lost their ability to detect their location or find their bearings at sea. The storm blew them off course and they ended up off the coast of Papua New Guinea. The two men were upbeat about their unplanned adventure. Rather than be distressed about their once-precarious plight, they enjoyed the potentially life-threatening escapade at sea. Mr Nanjikana said: "We didn't know where we were but did not expect to be in another country." They survived by eating oranges they had bought for their journey and coconuts they scooped out of the sea. A Papua New Guinean fisherman spotted their boat and authorities rescued them. Nanjikana said: "I look forward to going back home, but I guess it was a nice break from everything." However, due to COVID-19 restrictions, they will not be able to travel from Papua New Guinea to the Solomon Islands for a little while yet. The Kremlin had until now ruled out a new national lockdown like the one early on in the pandemic that dealt a heavy blow to the economy and sapped Putin’s popularity, empowering regional authorities across the country's 11 time zones to decide on local restrictions, depending on their situation. Many of Russia’s 85 regions already have restricted attendance at large public events and limited access to theatres, restaurants and other venues. Some have made vaccinations compulsory for certain public servants and people over 60. In some regions, mounting infections forced authorities to suspend medical assistance to the population as health care facilities were forced to focus on treating coronavirus patients. Vaccination remains low in the country despite the Kremlin being first to roll out a nationwide inoculation campaign and touting its homegrown Sputnik V jab abroad. According to Our World In Data, about 34% of the country's 146 million population have received at least one dose and 31% are fully vaccinated. On Tuesday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said unvaccinated people over 60 will be required to stay home. He also told businesses to keep at least a third of their employees working remotely for three months starting Oct. 25. Andersen called for governments to step up and take steps to close the "fossil fuel production gap" at the upcoming climate summit. While many governments have pledged to reduce emissions or set net-zero targets, they have not cut the production of fossil fuels, the study found, stating that this "production gap" has stayed largely unchanged since 2019. "As countries increasingly commit to net-zero emissions by mid-century, they also need to recognise the rapid reduction in fossil fuel production that their climate targets will require," he said. The report flags that G20 countries have directed nearly $300 billion (€258 billion) in new funds towards fossil fuel activities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic — more than they have toward clean energy. China is expected to boost oil and gas production by 5% and 58% and to decrease coal production by 8% by 2030; US authorities project production for oil and gas will increase by 17% and 12% respectively above 2019 levels by 2030, which would "largely go to exports"; while Moscow plans to increase gas and coal production by 38% and 52% respectively by 2035. "However, governments continue to plan for and support levels of fossil fuel production that are vastly in excess of what we can safely burn," he added. The UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, is being held from 31 October to 12 November in Glasgow, where world leaders will meet to discuss climate change. Cases haven’t been so high in the UK since July, and although the vaccination campaign appears to be keeping hospitalisations and deaths much lower than in previous periods of the pandemic, health leaders are warning action should be taken as the NHS prepares for “what could be the most challenging winter on record”. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation said: “It is time for the Government to enact Plan B of its strategy without delay because without preemptive action, we risk stumbling into a winter crisis.” He added a ‘Plan C’ should be considered should the Plan B measures be insufficient. The UK government’s current plan for the winter, in which seasonal illnesses such as flu are.
