The extension of general information systems has brought about with itself a bunch of privacy and security concerns not only for separate users but also for huge organizations. Here several aspects may be considered: all the private employee data and the companys important information is recorded in computers, besides there ere organizations that perform all their management and business activities via internet. All these points confirm the necessity of an organization to be responsible and keep an eye on computing systems and find out the real way of protecting oneself. The best way to be safe is to investigate and understand what common tricks are, and how to avoid getting into the wicked trap of hackers. For more vividity lets see what these words hacker and cracker mean. The core of the hacker definition used (and as it is used according to the hackers Jargon dictionary), a hacker is someone who just wants to know everything from a system just out of his pleasure, we with you as average users just acquire knowledge for using a system correctly and not exploiting it . People who apply this with the intention finding security flaws and holes in a system they are hackers. The other intruders who dont tend to vandalize the systems but to learn and apply some tricks to create viruses, break into system etc., are called crackers. They dont gain any new skills, knowledge or valuable information of an organization but make sure for themselves that they are apt to create a virus. To confront such problems in future, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was passed in 1984. It provided a number of legal measures to prosecute the malicious trespassers.
